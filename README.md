Hello and welcome to my git repo :)

**Clone: to do this copy the SSH key and git clone it using your Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Build: This project includes an array (!) of methods that have allowed me to programmatically build and design it. Feel free to check out my code (it's  mix of HTML, CSS, and Javascript)

**Run: to run it, you can either git clone or download the folder/files, and then run it via VS Code Liver Server to demo it. Note: you will need to set up Insomnia GET request and a POST request to save the payload via the RESTful API, and you can run the server using node.

**Contribute: If you'd like to contribute then that would be great as I continue to improve my Javascript files with higher order functions and pure functions. This is an open source repo!

Happy coding!

CyntiBinti :)
